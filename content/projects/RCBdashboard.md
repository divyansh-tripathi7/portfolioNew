## Description

The project is a Tableau dashboard that displays cricketing statistics of the Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) IPL team year by year. The dashboard provides an overview of the team's performance over the years by presenting data on the highest scorer, wicket-taker, 4s and 6s, number of wins, and total scores by match.

The data used to create the dashboard is sourced from official IPL records and websites. The data is pre-processed and cleaned to ensure consistency and accuracy. The dashboard is designed to be interactive, allowing users to filter and customize their view of the data.

The dashboard is composed of multiple visualizations, including bar charts, heat maps, and line graphs. The visualizations display the team's performance in a clear and concise manner, making it easy for users to compare and analyze the data. Users can also drill down into specific matches or players to gain more detailed insights.
