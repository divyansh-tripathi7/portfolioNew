## Description

The dashboard is created using data extracted from Airbnb's website and is pre-processed to ensure data consistency and accuracy. The dashboard is designed to allow users to explore the data and filter their searches based on specific criteria such as location, price, and property type.

The dashboard includes several visualizations, such as bar charts, heat maps, and scatter plots, which allow users to compare and analyze the data. Users can interact with the dashboard to analyze the data based on specific requirements, such as number of rooms, bathrooms, and price range.

The dashboard also provides data on cancellation policies, such as the number of listings with a flexible or strict policy, and their corresponding prices. This data can help users make informed decisions about booking Airbnb listings.
