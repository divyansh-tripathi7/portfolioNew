## Overview

The **Automated Multi-Agent Research System** is an advanced platform designed for generating comprehensive research reports. Leveraging a **multi-agent architecture**, this system automates the process of research report generation by integrating distinct agents with specialized roles. The project utilizes state-of-the-art technologies such as **LangGraph**, **LangChain**, and the **OpenAI API** to produce detailed reports in multiple formats including **PDF**, **Markdown**, and **DOCX**.

## Features

- **Multi-Agent Architecture**: The system consists of distinct agents that handle different aspects of the research report creation process:
  - **Researcher**: Gathers and curates research data.
  - **Writer**: Compiles the research data into a structured report.
  - **Reviewer**: Provides feedback on the draft report.
  - **Reviser**: Incorporates review feedback into the draft.
  - **Publisher**: Finalizes and publishes the report in various formats.

- **Output Formats**: Generates reports in multiple formats, including:
  - **PDF**
  - **Markdown**
  - **DOCX**

## Technologies Used

- **LangGraph**: Used for managing and coordinating the multi-agent workflows.
- **LangChain**: Facilitates seamless data processing and interaction between agents.
- **OpenAI API**: Provides advanced natural language processing capabilities to enhance the report generation process.

## Next Steps

- Expand the multi-agent architecture to include more specialized roles for additional research tasks.
- Incorporate more output formats such as LaTeX for academic publication-ready reports.
- Enhance the system's ability to interact with external databases for more comprehensive research gathering.
- Develop a user-friendly interface to interact with the system and customize the research report parameters.
