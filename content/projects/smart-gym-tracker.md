## Description

This project is a virtual assistant designed to assist with home workout exercises such as **pushups, squats, curls, and crunches**. The virtual assistant makes use of the **MediaPipe and CV2 libraries** to obtain landmarks for different body parts and ensure that the user is performing the exercises with the correct posture.

The virtual assistant verifies the user's posture by analyzing the landmarks of the user's body parts and checking them against predefined ranges for the correct posture. 
In addition to the posture verification, the project also includes a web app using **StreamLit** to enhance the user experience. The web app provides a user-friendly interface for users to select and perform exercises.
