## Description

**mediBot** is an end-to-end healthcare assistant application that provides personalized health recommendations based on patient inputs. This system utilizes a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** approach, which combines document retrieval with large language model generation. The core of the system is a **medically fine-tuned LLM** (Biomistral), which is tailored specifically to understand and respond to medical queries. 

The application is hosted on **AWS**, ensuring scalability and reliability, and features an **interactive UI** that makes it easy for patients to interact with the system and receive real-time health advice.

### Key Features

- **Health Recommendations**: The system uses the RAG approach to retrieve relevant medical information and generate tailored health recommendations based on user input.
- **Medically Fine-Tuned LLM**: The **Biomistral** model is fine-tuned to provide health-related insights, making it highly accurate for medical queries.
- **Interactive UI**: The user interface allows patients to easily input their symptoms and receive personalized advice, creating a user-friendly experience.
- **AWS Hosting**: The application is deployed on AWS, ensuring high availability and scalability for handling patient queries efficiently.

### Technologies Used

- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** for document retrieval and LLM-based generation.
- **Biomistral**: A fine-tuned LLM for medical applications.
- **AWS**: For hosting and deployment, providing scalability and security.
- **Streamlit/Flask/FastAPI**: For building the interactive UI and backend services.
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** for understanding and processing medical queries.

### Next Steps

- Improve the recommendation system by incorporating more health data and research.
- Expand the UI with additional features like user profile management and historical medical records.
- Integrate with medical databases for real-time health data and decision support.
- Enhance the model with continuous learning from user interactions to improve accuracy and relevance.
