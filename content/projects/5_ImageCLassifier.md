## Description

This project demonstrates how to train an **image classifier** from scratch using **TensorFlow** and **Keras** on the **Kaggle Cats vs Dogs dataset**. The goal is to classify images into two categories: cats and dogs. The project covers the following key steps:

- **Setting up the data**: Downloaded the Kaggle Cats vs Dogs dataset and prepared it for training.
- **Building the model**: Developed a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** from scratch.
- **Training and evaluation**: Trained the model and evaluated its performance on a test set.
- **Visualization**: Visualized the performance through accuracy and loss graphs, as well as kernel feature maps.

### Dataset

The model is trained on the Kaggle **Cats vs Dogs** dataset. You can access it [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/salader/dogs-vs-cats?select=train).

### Results

- Achieved **92% accuracy** on the test set.
- Visualized kernel feature maps to understand how the model makes decisions.

### Next Steps

- **Data Augmentation**: Experiment with data augmentation techniques to improve model generalization.
- **Model Architecture**: Refine the architecture to boost performance.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Explore tuning for optimal results.
- **Transfer Learning**: Implement transfer learning to reduce training time and improve results.
- **Deployment**: Save the model and deploy it for real-world applications.

### Technologies Used:
- **Deep Learning**: TensorFlow, Keras
- **Data Preprocessing**: NumPy, Matplotlib
- **Dataset**: Kaggle Cats vs Dogs
