## Description

Here we collected dataset from scratch and implemented word saliency based tf-idf weighing scheme and
page rank algorithm and are working on creating a pipeline to automate the process of summarization using
seq2seq and language models.Currently we are fine tuning bert models using hugging face to do the task.
