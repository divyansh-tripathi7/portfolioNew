## Description

To this end, we will lay the groundwork for a **"content-based book recommendation system,"** which will rank books in terms of how comparable their subject matter is.We create a **bag of words** model using unique stemmed tokens, and applying a **tf-idf model** (term frequencyâ€“inverse document frequency). Finally computing similarity of books
based on content using **cosine similarity**.
