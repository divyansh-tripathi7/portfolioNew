## Description

The **Calories Calculator** project allows users to input an image, which is then processed through the **Hugging Face Vision Transformer (ViT)** model to recognize the contents of the image. After the recognition step, the model performs processing to estimate the calories of the food item depicted in the image.

### Workflow

1. **Input Image**: The user uploads an image containing a food item.
2. **Image Processing**: The image is passed through the **ViT model** from Hugging Face for image recognition. The model analyzes the image and identifies the food item.
3. **Calorie Estimation**: Once the food item is recognized, the system calculates an estimated calorie count based on predefined information about common food items and their caloric content.

### Technologies Used

- **Vision Transformer (ViT)** from **Hugging Face** for image recognition.
- **Python** for backend processing.
- **Deep Learning** for object recognition.
  
### Next Steps

- Enhance the model's accuracy by expanding the food dataset for better recognition.
- Explore different models for calorie estimation to improve accuracy.
- Implement a more detailed database of food items for precise calorie calculations.
