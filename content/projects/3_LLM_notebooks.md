## Description

The **Transformers_1** repository contains a collection of notebooks showcasing various **Large Language Models (LLMs)** trained from scratch and fine-tuned for different natural language processing (NLP) tasks. This project is an exploration of the latest advancements in transformer architectures, demonstrating the power and versatility of models like **GPT**, **BERT**, and others in tasks such as text classification, language modeling, and more.

### Key Features

- **Training LLMs from Scratch**: Step-by-step guide to training transformer-based models from scratch.
- **Fine-Tuning Pretrained Models**: Fine-tuning of popular pretrained transformers (e.g., GPT, BERT) on specific datasets for improved task performance.
- **Multiple Notebooks**: The repository includes multiple notebooks, each focusing on a different aspect of LLMsâ€”training, fine-tuning, and evaluation.

### Use Cases

- **Text Classification**: Fine-tune models to classify texts into categories.
- **Text Generation**: Train models to generate meaningful text.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Apply transformers to understand sentiment in text data.
  
### Technologies Used

- **Transformers**: Hugging Face's transformers library.
- **PyTorch** and **TensorFlow** for model training and deployment.
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques for tasks like tokenization, embeddings, and sequence classification.
  
### Next Steps

- Experiment with additional transformer models like **T5**, **RoBERTa**, and **DistilBERT**.
- Explore task-specific fine-tuning for specialized applications like summarization, translation, and question-answering.
- Improve model efficiency with techniques like pruning, quantization, and knowledge distillation.
