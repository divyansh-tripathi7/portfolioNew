## Description

This project aims to **train an image classifier from scratch** to detect emotions from facial expressions using the **Kaggle FER-2013 Dataset**. The model classifies images into **seven emotion categories** based on facial expressions, utilizing various approaches to improve its accuracy and robustness.

### Approaches

#### 1. **Custom CNN From Scratch**:
- Built a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** from scratch, using layers like **Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, BatchNormalization, Dropout, Flatten**, and **Dense**.
- The model architecture was designed to gradually extract features from the input images and classify them into seven emotion categories.
- Trained on the **FER-2013 dataset**.

#### 2. **Custom CNN With Augmentation**:
- Applied **data augmentation techniques** (random rotations, shifts, shears, zooms, and horizontal flips) to improve model performance and generalization.
- Enhanced robustness by training on augmented data, allowing the model to recognize emotions from various perspectives and variations.
- Trained on the **FER-2013 dataset**.

#### 3. **Transfer Learning with VGG16**:
- Leveraged the pre-trained **VGG16** model for **transfer learning**.
- Fine-tuned the VGG16 model on the emotion detection task by replacing the final classification layer and training on the FER-2013 dataset.
- Transfer learning benefited from the large dataset knowledge learned by VGG16, speeding up training and improving performance.

#### 4. **Transfer Learning with ResNet50**:
- Explored transfer learning with the **ResNet50** model, another widely used CNN architecture.
- Fine-tuned the ResNet50 model on the FER-2013 dataset to adapt its learned features to the emotion detection task.
- Compared the results of transfer learning with **VGG16** and **ResNet50** to identify the most effective approach.

### Dataset

The project uses the **FER-2013 dataset** available on Kaggle, which consists of over 35,000 labeled images of faces with seven emotion categories: anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, surprise, and neutral.

### Results

The project evaluates each approach's performance, comparing:
- **Custom CNN from scratch**.
- **Data Augmented CNN**.
- **Transfer Learning with VGG16 and ResNet50**.

By the end of the project, we identified the most effective approach for detecting emotions from facial expressions.

### Next Steps
- Experiment with more advanced augmentation techniques to further improve model generalization.
- Evaluate the model's performance on a real-time facial emotion detection application.
- Explore other transfer learning models, such as **InceptionV3** or **MobileNet** for efficiency.
