Hello and welcome to my portfolio website! My name is Divyansh Tripathi,I am a Pre Final year student of Electronics and Communication Engineering department at NIT Hamirpur.

I believe Data is the new gold and will open doors to an unimaginable and exciting age for humanity,Naturally I wish to be a part of this revolution through my knowledge of data science which includes:

 * Data Visualisation
 * Machine Learning
 * Deep Learning


In my free time you may find me tinkering with hardware, watching animes, reading history/philosophy, writing poetry or sharing my thoughts with my peers.
